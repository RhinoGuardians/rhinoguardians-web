## 💚 Mission

**Every day, one rhino is killed by poachers.** Black rhino populations have crashed from ~70,000 (1970) to just 2,410 today. 

RhinoGuardians combines AI, open-source tech, and passionate rangers to protect Africa's most endangered species. Together, we can bring them back from the brink of extinction.
